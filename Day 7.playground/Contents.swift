// However, Swift knows the parameter to that closure must be a string, so we can remove it:
travel3 { place -> String in
    return "I'm going to \(place) in my car"
}

// It also knows the closure must return a string, so we can remove that:
travel3 { place in
    return "I'm going to \(place) in my car"
}

// As the closure only has one line of code that must be the one that returns the value, so Swift lets us remove the return keyword too:
travel3 { place in
    "I'm going to \(place) in my car"
}

// Swift has a shorthand syntax that lets you go even shorter. Rather than writing place in we can let Swift provide automatic names for the closureâ€™s parameters. These are named with a dollar sign, then a number counting from 0.
travel3 {
